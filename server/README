API Server
==========

PHP RESTful API server.

Installation
------------

1) Put all files somewhere into HTTP server root (e.g. Apache).
2) Be sure to have only 'public' folder accessible via HTTP requests.
3) Be sure to have 'log' and 'temp' directories writable.
4) Setup database connection in 'app/config.ini'.
5) Create database in your MySQL.
6) In command line (CLI PHP needed!) launch 'php data/load.php'. This
   script should install database contents. Schema is always the same,
   but according to settings in the script (see contents of 'data/load.php')
   loads 'test-fixtures' (development) or 'fixtures' (production).
7) Database & server should be ready now!
